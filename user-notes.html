= general notes
. page layout is just from that todo meteor tutorial
. I'll work on editing, saving, and editing a note
. Maybe you could work on making this look more like pastebin.com or at least better looking
. Feel free to give me any questions or comments
. After the above, I suppose next is the user system and the custom navigation of a "note"
. "note" is in quotes as it might be stored in a different way than a .txt file would, I think.
. I'm thinking that implementing the note creation functionality would be probably be pretty simple.
. I'll be tossing notes everywhere.
= technical notes
. while pushing, I get 6 errors that I assume that I can ignore, there is probably a plugin I should get.
. using some accounts package for unimplemented accounts functionality, I'll look up what I used
. iron router for separate pages

<!--
I use special symbols to denote titles and things
basically:
[# > = > - > .]
# means higher significance
. means low significance or list element and so on.
= sometimes means a personal comment? well, a comment comment?
also:
[### > ## > #]
more symbol thingies means more significance
but I don't use them all the time.

The concept for markers is for the client to catch the string "#### marker name ####"
and have the client? scroll down the page as much as possible (in the case the marker is at the bottom of the note text)
to show the location that marker is located.

<!-- ### Meteor Partial Page Templates ### -->

<!--
## main page template
displayed on every page
gives basic navigation and login/account details/functions
-->
<template name="main">
    {{> navigation}} <!-- navigation to other pages -->
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <div class="col-sm-12">
            {{> yield}} <!-- line where the content appears -->
        </div>
    </div>
</template>

<!--### Page Content Templates ###-->

<!--
## home content template
contains what is displayed on the first page
currently displays project definition that should be in the about page
towards the end, may become the "create new note" page
-->
<template name="home">
    <h2>User Notes</h2>
    <p>
        Initial simple idea is to create a web page for a user to read and write basic simple notes quickly.
        A user may create multiple notes with perhaps some limit.
    </p>
    <p>The base initial features include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>special markers that a user could jump to while editing/viewing their text</li>
        <li>double columns for optimal usage of window space</li>
        <li>resizeable dual view of the same or 2 douments in one window</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Possible features include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>tabbed files, like excel has multiple sheets</li>
        <li>simple spreadsheets with basic functions implemented</li>
        <li>html, js, cs writing and viewing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Site concepts taken from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Docs, paste bin, wikipedia, spreadsheet software, text document software</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Todo:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>document edit page</li>
        <li>documents page</li>
        <li>login page</li>
    </ul>
