    = goals =
  note creation
  note reading
  user accounts
  note jump markers (reading)
  note jump markers (writing)
  note editing

    = who did what =
  layout: grant
  note creation functionality: grant
  basic user accounts: grant
  note accessibility: grant
  most of the complex code: grant

  initial page creation: erick
  concept: erick
  very very very very very very little code: erick

    = progress =
  user accounts don't have much usage currently
  a note takes the id of the user as its author

    = to do =
  note jump markers (reading)
  note jump markers (writing)
  note editing
  note deletion
  note date & author listing
  confirmation a note is created

    = general notes =
  . for the complexity of the project, I'd say we need to have one more point of custom functionality
      after the the things listed in the to do list.
  . test and display a large note of multiple lines(100-200)
  . define the possible limit of text of a note
  . concept: recognize "[pg split]" string as location to display text below this string in 2nd column
  . name anchor to be in <a> elements, id anchor in any element

  ############## id anchor works ###########
  ##== internal linking concept:
  === before a note displays on the display-notes page when it is clicked
  == using jquery, it transforms specific special text to a page element with a unique name in its "id" tag
    - specific text that is "marked" perhaps like ####marker####, an internal link would link to that
      text.
  == initially, place internal links to the markers in a list at the top of the display-notes page
  ## implementing internal links while writing a note seems to be much more difficult.
  ex:
    <a href="#notes1">notes 1</a> internal link
    <h2 id="notes1">User Notes</h2> position to change view to

<!-- ## meteor notes ##
  - need to create a route for every page in the js file and update navigation page.
  - meteor dislikes '-' characters or dashes in template names, maybe.

<!-- ## encountered problems ##
  - was having errors in the webpage console with having the '-' character in template names.

<!--
  I use special symbols to denote titles and things
  basically:
    [# > = > - > .]
  # means higher significance
  . means low significance or list element and so on.
  = sometimes means a personal comment? well, a comment comment?
  also:
    [### > ## > #]
  more symbol thingies means more significance
  but I don't use them all the time.

  The concept for markers is for the client to catch the string "#### marker name ####"
  and have the client? scroll down the page as much as possible (in the case the marker is at the bottom of the note text)
  to show the location that marker is located.

        Initial simple idea is to create a web page for a user to read and write basic simple notes quickly.
        A user may create multiple notes with perhaps some limit.
      </p>
      <p>The base initial features include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>special markers that a user could jump to while editing/viewing their text</li>
        <li>double columns for optimal usage of window space</li>
        <li>resizeable dual view of the same or 2 different documents in one window</li>
        <li>organizable notes such as in groups/folders/tags</li>
        <li>private notes available to user who made them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Possible features include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>tabbed files, like excel has multiple sheets</li>
        <li>simple spreadsheets with basic functions implemented</li>
        <li>html, js, cs writing and viewing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Site concepts taken from:</p>

        <li>Google Docs, paste bin, wikipedia, spreadsheet software, text document software</li>
      </ul>
