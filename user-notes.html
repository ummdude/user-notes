= general notes
. how the page looks really needs to be changed from how it currently looks
. I'll work on editing, saving, and editing a note
. Maybe you could work on making this look more like pastebin.com or at least better looking
. Feel free to give me any questions or comments
. After the above, I suppose next is the user system and the custom navigation of a "note"
. "note" is in quotes as it might be stored in a different way than a .txt file would, I think.
. I'm thinking that implementing the note creation functionality would be probably be pretty simple.
. I'll be tossing notes everywhere.
= technical notes
. while pushing, I get 6 errors that I assume that I can ignore, there is probably a plugin I should get.
. using some accounts package for unimplemented accounts functionality, I'll look up what I used
. iron router for separate pages

<!--
I use special symbols to denote titles and things
basically:
[# > = > - > .]
# means higher significance
. means low significance or list element and so on.
= sometimes means a personal comment? well, a comment comment?
also:
[### > ## > #]
more symbol thingies means more significance
but I don't use them all the time.

  <h2>User Notes</h2>
  <p>
    Initial simple idea is to create a web page for a user to read and write basic simple notes quickly.
    A user may create multiple notes with perhaps some limit.
  </p>
  <p>The base initial features include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>special markers that a user could jump to while editing/viewing their text</li>
    <li>double columns for optimal usage of window space</li>
    <li>resizeable dual view of the same or 2 douments in one window</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Possible features include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>tabbed files, like excel has multiple sheets</li>
    <li>simple spreadsheets with basic functions implemented</li>
    <li>html, js, cs writing and viewing</li>
  </ul>
    <p>Site concepts taken from:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Docs, paste bin, wikipedia, spreadsheet software, text document software</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Todo:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>document edit page</li>
    <li>documents page</li>
    <li>login page</li>
  </ul>
